- This project includes a training module, where two datasets (EMNIST and MNIST) were used to train two models.
- The models can recognize hand written numbers or letters that are drawn on the window.

- PyGame is used to create a window/ canvas where the user can draw, and be told what letter or number they have drawn.
- Note: The letter model is not very accurate.
- Note: It can only recognize one letter or number at a time. 
- Note: The user still needs to tell what model to use based on what they have drawn, by pressing:
         * N for Numbers
         * A for Letters
         * Esc key to reset the canvas
